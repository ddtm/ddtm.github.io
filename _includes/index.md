<h3 class="page-header">About</h3>

I am a PhD candidate at [MILA](https://mila.umontreal.ca/) advised by [Yoshua Bengio](https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/person/bengio-yoshua/)
and co-advised by [Victor Lempitsky](http://sites.skoltech.ru/compvision/members/vilem/) of Skoltech.
My scientific interests span computer vision and machine learning. Nowadays
I'm mostly working on __artificial neural networks__.

If you really want to, you can access my typed [curriculum vitae](./media/cv2.pdf), 
although I tend to update the <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/yganin/">LinkedIn</a> 
<a href="http://linkedin.com/in/yganin/"><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square fa-lg"></i></a>

{% endcapture %}
{% capture project_desc %}
A deep learning system for real-time gaze redirection. We propose a novel architecture
that predicts a warping transformation (much like remap in OpenCV) and thus does not
suffer from problems (information loss, regression-to-mean, etc.) of conventional 
encoder-decoder approaches.

Accepted to __ECCV'16__.

### 2015

{% capture project_title %}

{% endcapture %}
{% capture project_desc %}
Deep neural networks can be adapted for the new domains by incorporating 
unlabeled data into the learning procedure. Very easy to implement, yet 
gives state-of-the-art results on the 
<a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~saenko/projects.html#data">Office dataset</a> 
and several other benchmarks.

Links to the datasets: [MNIST-M](https://bit.ly/3BRU8Ap), [SynNumbers](http://bit.ly/2gABD9s).
I'm also providing an [unpacked version of MNIST-M](https://bit.ly/3t4S3gI) (courtesy of Konstantinos Bousmalis).

We propose a simple two-step approach for speeding up convolution layers within 
large convolutional neural networks based on tensor decomposition and discriminative fine-
tuning.

### 2012

{% capture project_title %}

__Yaroslav Ganin__
{% endcapture %}

{% capture project_img_path %}./images/seg_trees/teaser2.png{% endcapture %}

{% capture project_pdf %}
http://developer.download.nvidia.com/GTC/PDF/GTC2012/Posters/P0496_Efficient_Segmentation_Trees_by_Ganin.pdf
{% endcapture %}
{% capture project_desc %}
Here's how one may get a segmentation tree via 
[Bor≈Øvka's MST algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bor%C5%AFvka%27s_algorithm). 
No wheels were reinvented in the making of this project. 
Pure [Thrust](http://thrust.github.io/) (well, almost).

Accepted for a poster presentation at __GTC'12__.

You can find the code in the 
[CUDA Toolkit bundle](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-samples/index.html#cuda-segmentation-tree-thrust-library).
